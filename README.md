# Techdegree Project 1
## A Number Guessing Game
This project is a console/terminal based number guessing game.
The program will select a number between 1 and 10 at random, and prompt the user to guess what the number is.
Feedback is provided to the user after each incorrect attempt ("Number is higher or lower"), until the user guesses the correct number.
The user is displayed with the number of tries it took to guess the correct number and is asked if they want to play again.
The high score (lowest number of attempts) is displayed at the start of each game played.
